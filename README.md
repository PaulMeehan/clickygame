**Purpose:**
This application is an example of React Components and using the State to manipulate the User Interface.  The application is a "Clicky" memory game testing the users ability to remember which images they already selected while the images are being shuffeled around.

**User instructions:**

  The application can be run directly from the deployment on my GitHub account [by clicking here.](https://paulmeehan.github.io/clickygame/)

  The object of the game is to click on as many images as possible without selecting any one image twice.  Between each click, the images will be randomly rearraged.

  As you continue to select images, your score will be displayed in the ribbon at the top along with the top score.
